# Sentiment analysis on AWS SageMaker
---
In this project, I demonstrate how to create and deploy an NLP model using AWS SageMaker tools. <br>
The model I have chosen is called distilBERT and is a pretrained Hugging Face model. <br>
After the deployment stage, this model is made accessible through an API, enabling it to perform sentiment analysis tasks on fly. <br>
