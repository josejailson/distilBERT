# Sentiment analysis on AWS SageMaker
---
In this project, I demonstrate how to create and deploy an NLP model using AWS SageMaker tools. 
The model I have chosen is a pretrained Hugging Face distilBERT. 
After the deployment stage, this model is made accessible through an API, enabling it to perform sentiment analysis tasks.
